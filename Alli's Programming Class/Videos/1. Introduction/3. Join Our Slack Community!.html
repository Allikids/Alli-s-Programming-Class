            <p>To make sure that you all succeed with this course, one of your fellow students had a great idea and now it is a reality (Thank you Robin Watson!).  
<br><br>
We have created a slack channel for all the student of The Complete Web Developer in 2018. A lot of companies use Slack to communicate across teams, and every job I have had as a developer uses Slack. In the spirit of keeping the course as useful as possible for employment in 2018, we are introducing a slack channel where you can: </p>

<p><strong>- Introduce yourself 
<br>- Ask the community questions 
<br>- Get help with exercises <br>
- Meet other students around the world 
<br>- Learn how to answer questions <br>
- Learn from each other</strong></p>















<p>I am very excited about this but it will only work if everybody helps each other out. I know it isn't for everybody, but being able to ask questions and help others when they have questions is the best way to learn. The Q&amp;A section in the course will still be available and I will still answer every question. However, the Slack channel should give you faster replies from the community and learn another valuable tool of a developer.
<br><br>
I hope you find it useful. To join the group, go to <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/zero-to-mastery/shared_invite/enQtMzExOTc3MDQwMjYwLWQ0ZjJjZTFlMjdmNDJiMzI5MWUxNjRlZjU1MTE4ZGE5ZGJiZWQwMTJjZGIyMmFmY2VkNzAwMTMxMWNiMGE0MGQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this link here</a>. Once there, you can sign up, and click on channels to explore different topics. 
<br><br>
I'll see you in there, and let's make 2018 awesome!<br><br><br>(Thanks to Caleb, a fellow student, for contributing the below icon!)</p>
