            <p><strong>Before we get started, let's do a quick activity that won't take you more than 5 minutes. </strong><br><br><strong>#1 </strong>Please introduce yourself in the community slack group in the <strong>#general</strong> channel to get familiar with how it works! If you don't have Slack, please go to the previous lecture to see how to get it. Quickly share who you are, where you are from, and why you chose to do this course. Doing this course yourself is completely fine, but it is always good to have a community of others, similar to you, helping you when you need motivation, and sharing in the joy when you succeed.<br><br><strong>#2 </strong>Go to the <strong>#programming-buddies.</strong> I want everyone here to find a partner to work with. We all need a programming buddy, so that is what we'll be doing today, finding programming buddies<strong>! You will be keeping each other accountable throughout the course and motivating each other to finish. </strong>I know it may sound silly, but this is the biggest factor in completing the course. Who knows, maybe you will find life long friends / coworkers this way. <br><br><strong>#3 </strong>Our community is growing and slack has a lot of discussions. Check out different channels and especially <strong>#recapoftheday</strong> channel in order to help you stay up to date with this slack community. As our community grows it will be difficult to keep up with all the channels. <strong>#recapoftheday</strong> will only be one or two posts a day only by myself or a few of the administrators with important messages that you may have missed from slack. This way you can always make sure you are up to date with what's happening. Hope you find this useful!<br><br>Some of the channels available for you to join:<br><strong>#dev - </strong>Myself and others share interesting articles and tools we find. Great way to stay up to date in the industry<br><strong>#alumni - </strong>Ask graduates of this course questions<br><strong>#womenintech - </strong>For the female coders out there<br><strong>#job-hunting - </strong>Anything related to finding a job as a developer<br><strong>#code100 - </strong>To join a community of students dedicated to code every day for 100 days. You can join anytime<br>....and many many more!<br></p><p><strong>Trust me, the slack group is an invaluable part of this course. </strong><br></p>



<p>If you don't feel comfortable with slack, then you can introduce yourself in the Q&amp;A forum (see the next lecture to find out how to do that)</p>
